Copy name to clipboard
	V1.0.1


What is it?
	Copy name to clipboard is a Tracker add-on to copy the names of the
	selected files and folders (together with their paths) into the clipboard.


How to un/install?
	To install the add-on, drag&drop the add-on "Copy name to clipboard-C"
	onto the folder "Drop here to install".

	Tip:	Change the the suffix "C" of the add-on's name to change the
		shortcut from ALT+OPT+C to some other letter.		

	To uninstall, just doubleclick the "Drop here to install" folder and remove
	the add-on from there.


How does it work?
	Select files and folders in a Tracker window and invoke the Tracker add-on.
	Now paste the contents of the clipboard into a text editor, for example.

	If the file name contains spaces, it is surrounded by quotation marks.

	The following modifier key features won't work when invoking the add-on
	with the keyboard shortcut, use the mouse instead:

	Holding SHIFT while calling this add-on, copies the file names without paths.
	Holding CONTROL while calling this add-on, prints one file name per line.


Thanks!
